    "In AI, an agent is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators.  For our workshop, we will create a simple agent and place it in a maze. The maze is our environment, and the agent's goal is to find a path from a starting point to a destination. This simple model is a powerful way to understand the core concepts behind much more complex AI systems, like the ones used in legal tech or logistics.\n",

    "**Informed Search:** We will make our agent \"intelligent\" by giving it a heuristic, allowing it to use the A* Search algorithm to find the optimal path efficiently.\n"
