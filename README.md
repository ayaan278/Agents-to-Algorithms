# Agents-to-Algorithms

Welcome to the official repository for the "From Agents to Intelligent Search" workshop. This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks and materials needed to replicate the workshop, from creating an AI agent's environment to comparing the performance of classic search algorithms.

The workshop tells a story, starting with the simple idea that AI is a tool for problem-solving (like Google Maps navigating a city) and culminating in a data-driven comparison of different strategies an AI can use to "think."

## üìö Table of Contents

This workshop is broken down into a series of labs. It is highly recommended to run them in the specified order.

* **`Lab_01_Environment_Setup.ipynb`**: **The World and The Agent**
    * Learn how to create a standardized maze environment using the `pyamaze` library, save it to a file (`workshop_maze.csv`), and visualize it.

* **`Lab_02_DFS.ipynb`**: **The Brute-Force Explorer**
    * Implement and visualize the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We measure its performance and see its simple, yet often inefficient, "deep-dive" strategy.

* **`Lab_03_BFS.ipynb`**: **The Meticulous Planner**
    * Implement and visualize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We see how it guarantees the shortest path at the cost of exploring a massive area and discuss a key data structure optimization (`deque`).

* **`Lab_04_A_Star.ipynb`**: **The Intelligent Navigator**
    * Implement the A\* (A-Star) search algorithm. We introduce the concept of a heuristic and observe how this "educated guess" allows the agent to find the optimal path with incredible efficiency. We also analyze the "jump" visualization as a sign of intelligent decision-making.

* **`Lab_05_Comparison.ipynb`**: **The Performance Showdown**
    * Load the performance data (`.csv` file) generated by the previous labs and create compelling graphs to compare the algorithms on Execution Time, Explored Cells (Work), and Final Path Length (Solution Quality).

* **`Lab_06_The_DFS_Challenge.ipynb`**: **The "Gotcha" Moment (Bonus)**
    * A bonus lab that demonstrates a special-case scenario where the "dumbest" algorithm (DFS) can actually outperform the "smartest" (A\*), in terms of speed and BFS in terms of exploratory cells, teaching a valuable lesson about the importance of understanding the problem's structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you will need the following installed on your system:

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Jupyter Notebook** or JupyterLab
* **Git** (for cloning the repository)
* **(Optional) Ghostscript:** For saving maze images on some operating systems (especially Windows), you may need to install Ghostscript. You can download it from [ghostscript.com](https://www.ghostscript.com/download.html).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your local environment and run the labs.

**1. Clone the Repository:**
Clone the repository

**2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
It's best practice to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.
```bash
# For Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**3. Install the Required Libraries:**
All necessary Python libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them with a single pip command.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
Once the installation is complete, you can start the Jupyter server.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Your web browser will open with the Jupyter interface, showing all the lab notebooks.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run the Labs

1.  Start by opening and running all cells in **`Lab_01_Environment_Setup.ipynb`**. This will create the `workshop_maze.csv` file that all other labs depend on.
2.  Next, run **`Lab_02`**, **`Lab_03`**, and **`Lab_04`** in any order. Each one will run an algorithm and append its performance data to `performance_results.csv`.
3.  Once the first four labs are complete, run **`Lab_05_Comparison.ipynb`** to see the final performance graphs.
4.  Finally, run the bonus **`Lab_06_The_DFS_Challenge.ipynb`** for the final surprising result!
